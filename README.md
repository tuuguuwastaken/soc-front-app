# IMPORTANT

## Since this is your first project with working as a team, please make your own branches

## and name it accordingly to the place you wroking with,because branch conflicts are annoying to fix

more will be added in the future

scroll below to get good practise for code and other methods to deal with problems

## frame work we are using

`Vue 3` for design and css we are using `sass or scss` for css framework we are using `andt design for vue`

## to make a new branch

```
git branch (name)

```

## to upload the branch to the dev branch (MAIN IS FOR PRODUCTION PLEASE UNDERSTAND IF YOU DO THE BRANCH WILL BE A MESS)

branch is just a collection of commits, so when you push your updates to the branch you created its just uploading the commits commit is a different version of the code you did, you can go back a commit or just hard reset it to the latest commit on github

```
git commit -m "message"

```

make sure your commit message are meaning full so others can understand like "fixed: login not sending correct info" or "added: login connected to backend" the first time your are pushing to you branch

```
git push --set-upstream origin (branch-name)

```

after you do this, in the future on the same branch you can do push

```
git push

```

^^ this will be fine after the first

```
!!! IMTPORTANT COMMIT OFTEN AND RIGHT BEFORE YOU PUSH COMMIT THEN PUSH

```

## Project setup

```
npm install

```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```
npm run serve

```

### Compiles and minifies for production (just do npm run serve for development)

```
npm run build

```

### Lints and fixes files

```
npm run lint

```

### Customize configuration

See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).

# Reminders

we are using andt design for vue use this [documentation for the css framework](https://antdv.com/components/overview) so you dont have to write alot of css if you have to make a css file until you get alot of experience please tell me what you plan onmaking custom css so we can find other alternatives than using pure scss

## if making custom css watch out for

make sure to start the classes with soc(or something we agree on after) if its used alot please put the scss file in the components folder

## several good practises for web dev

### organize

folder organization is important, if its a page do it in the views folder (see other files for eg and follow accordingly)

### make it simple

dont make over complicated code, if simple code can make it work without issues just go with it, complicated code will have problems in the future

### comment so others understand

comment the code you wrote so others can understand what the code does when it comes to bug fixing ( comment if you dont wanna be bugged on how the code works)

### if you dont know how to fix talk to others

if you have a problem or you dont know how to fix it, talk to someone (if you want extra credits talk to someone else than me tuugii) work together to find a solution, thats what teamwork is for, working together and finding a solution in a day is better than thinking alone and finally finding a subpar solution in 2 hours

### dont give up.

there are times where we dont know what to do or how to fix it, dont give up, just try doing the first thing that comes to mind if it doesnt work console log the output or the process of it. you just give up thats not gonna help you in the long run. just do it, if it doesnt work. Learn from it. this project is meant for you guys to learn

### ask me if you are stumped on what to do

i will help you as much as i can, if i deem its good for you guys to get experience, i will give you hints# IMPORTANT
